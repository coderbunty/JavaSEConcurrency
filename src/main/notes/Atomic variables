Atomic variables

The java.util.concurrent.atomic package defines classes that support atomic operations on single variables. All classes
have get and set methods that work like reads and writes on volatile variables. That is, a set has a happens-before
relationship with any subsequent get on the same variable. The atomic compareAndSet method also has these memory consistency
features, as do the simple atomic arithmetic methods that apply to integer atomic variables.
