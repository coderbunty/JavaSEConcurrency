In Linux, init is a abbreviation for Initialization. The init is a daemon process which starts as soon as the computer
starts and continue running till, it is shutdown. In-fact init is the first process that starts when a computer boots,
making it the parent of all other running processes directly or indirectly and hence typically it is assigned “pid=1“.

If somehow init daemon could not start, no process will be started and the system will reach a stage called “Kernel Panic“.
init is most commonly referred to as System V init.

For  systems running SysV Init, you can check the status of services by running,
# service <service_name> start/stop/restart/status
                       (or)
# /etc/init.d/<service_name> start/stop/restart/status

The need to replace init with something more perfect was felt from a long time and several alternatives were developed
from time-to-time, some of which became distribution’s native init replacement, some of which are:
upstart, epoch, mudar, systemd



A systemd is a System Management Daemon named with UNIX convention to add ‘d‘ at the end of daemon. Similar to init,
systemd is the parent of all other processes directly or indirectly and is the first process that starts at boot hence
typically assigned a “pid=1“. It was designed to overcome the shortcomings of init. It itself is a background processes
which is designed to start processes in parallel, thus reducing the boot time and computational overhead. It has a lot
other features as compared to init. Moving forward, applications on Linux are designed to uses the systemd method, not
any other.

For  systemd services, you can use 'systemctl' command to check the status,
# systemctl start/stop/restart/status <service_name>
